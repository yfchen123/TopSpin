# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to explore the effect of using different PDB algorithms on the TopSpin problem and to benchmark the performance of the various algorithms. For the puzzle we generated random solvable configurations. In TopSpin
a configuration is solvable if the start configuration and the end configuration 
have the same parities. The proof is demonstrated in the paper below: https://digitalrepository.salemstate.edu/bitstream/handle/20.500.13013/607/auto_convert.pdf?sequence=3.
